# Agricultural Product Traceability Project

## **Initial Scope**
- Focus on a specific agricultural product (e.g., coffee)  
- Pilot with 1-2 partner cooperatives/farms  
- Select a limited geographic area  

## **MVP Features**
- Simple smart contract to store product information  
- QR codes for each batch  
- Basic web interface for:
  - Farmers to update cultivation information  
  - Consumers to look up information  
  - Viewing transaction history on the blockchain  

## **Implementation Timeline (2-3 Months)**
- **Team:**  
  - 1 blockchain developer  
  - 1 frontend developer  
  - 1 operations and partner liaison  

## **Low Initial Costs**
- Use testnet for development  
- Minimal hardware requirements  
- Leverage farmers' existing smartphones  

## **Demonstrable Value**
- Farmers benefit from transparent information  
- Consumers can directly verify product information  
- Measurable metrics (number of scans, transactions)
